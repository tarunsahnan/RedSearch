RedSearch

I have created a website where user has access to almost every filter that one needs while searching for something on reddit. In this project, I used [Pushshift API](https://github.com/pushshift/api). The pushshift.io Reddit API was designed and created by the /r/datasets mod team to help provide enhanced functionality and search capabilities for searching Reddit comments and submissions.

## Overview
One can easiy search on reddit with this app with proper filters. I have disabled adult content so that user will not feel uncomfortable while using this website at work locations. I have tried to make it as user-friendly as possible. Also, I have tried to provide every possible filter to this web app. 

This app contains 3 options:
1. None: No filter is selected -> This option displays posts only in the descending order of creation date
2. Submission: This option displays posts with the selected filters only.
3. Comment: This option comments posts with the selected filters only.

By default, each request shows 25 posts.

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
